# This build script is meant to abstract all the special flags and configurations required for each
# build mode.
#
# In order to keep it simple, it has been made as a bash script, but if it grows in complexity, it's
# better to refactor it into a dart program, as all devs in this project know dart and it's easier
# to work with than a complex bash script.
